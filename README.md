# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
An artist's play came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
### Purpose
To use an existing kickstarter dataset in Excel to create a visualization analysis for the campaign outcomes based on launch dates and the funding goals to help the artist make an informed decision for her fundraising project. 


## Analysis and Challenges
There were no challenges - I had enough clean data to help me analyze her fundraising expectations.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
April to July is the best window to launch a successful fundraising campaign. With May and June being the best two months. 
I would recommend she go ahead and launch her play fundraising. Make sure she ends her campaign by the end of July.
The failure rate is high in October due to the ongoing sportings activities - 
MLB playoff begins, the NFL and NBA also in progress.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I found out smaller goals were successful. The data show goals set less than $5,000 become successful while exceeding $10,000 fail. 
If she plans to set her goals less than $5,000, I say go for it. Good luck, and I hope this analysis is helpful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There are outliers in the dataset for the successful campaigns goals which ranged from $1 to $400,000.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?  
A successful fundraising campaign window is short. She only has May and June to wrap-up her campaign, else it's bound to fail. Another conclusion is that October has the highest failure rate in the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?  
She should set her goals low, like $5,000 or less in order to have a successful campaign.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?  
The dataset covers less than 10 years of campaignes (2009 to 2017) and doestn't consider during a natural disater such as 2020 pandermic year or September 11 terror attack


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?  
We could've created bar charts to visualize the data as well.
